# Privacy Policy for EasyMap

**Last Updated:** [2025-11-23]

## Introduction
EasyMap ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Google Sheets Add-on uses your data.

## Data Collection and Use
**We do not collect, store, or share any of your data.**

*   **Data Processing**: The app processes the data in your Google Sheet (specifically Latitude and Longitude columns) solely for the purpose of displaying it on the map within your browser.
*   **Data Storage**: All data remains in your Google Sheet. We do not save your data to any external server or database.
*   **User Identity**: We do not collect your email address, name, or any personal information.

## Third-Party Services
*   **Google Maps / OpenStreetMap**: The app uses mapping libraries (Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap tiles) to render the map. These services may receive your IP address to serve map tiles, but they do not receive your spreadsheet data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, including changes related to future premium features or service limits. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
