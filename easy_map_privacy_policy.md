Last updated: 2025-11-23

Introduction

Easy Map ("we", "us", "our") provides map and location services through our app and related services (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use Easy Map.

1. Information We Collect

- Information you provide: account information (email address, display name), profile data, support requests, and any other information you choose to submit.
- Device and usage information: device model, operating system, app version, crash logs, performance data, and analytics about how you use the app.
- Location information: with your permission, we collect precise (GPS) and/or approximate location data while you use Easy Map to provide navigation, location search, and related features.
- Cookies and similar technologies: we use cookies and local storage to store preferences and enable features.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve Easy Map and its features.
- Personalize your experience and provide location-based services.
- Communicate with you, respond to support requests, and send updates about the Service.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the Service and detect issues.

3. Sharing and Disclosure

We will not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
- With service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, crash reporting), under contracts that require them to protect the data.
- If required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of Easy Map, our users, or others.

4. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party service providers (for maps, analytics, hosting). These services have their own privacy policies — please review them. We only share the minimum data required for those services to operate.

5. Data Retention

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements.

6. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Children

Easy Map is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

8. Your Choices

- Location permissions: you can disable or revoke location permissions in your device settings; disabling may reduce functionality.
- Communications: you can opt out of promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in those messages.

9. International Transfers

Your data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. We will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards when transferring personal data across borders.

10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice in the app or updating the "Last updated" date.
